Introduction
============

This is a skeleton build system that was hacked together from the nightly
build structure. 

It will make installations of QMP, QDP++ and Chroma for the Jlab machines.
The current targets that will be built and installed are:

How Does it work
================

In this directory are subdirectories for the modules to build:
	qmp, qdp++ and chroma

In each subdirectory is a set of directories corresponding to various
targets eg:

	qmp/
	   ib-mpi/
	   single/

Each target further contains a subdirectory called 'build'  which contains
at least a script called 'configure.sh'. Eg:

	qmp/
	    ib-mpi/
	           configure.sh


The purpose of this script is to create a structure such that
after configure.sh completes one can run the following make invocations:

	make -k
	make -k install
	make -k check
	make -k uninstall
	make -k distcean

The configure script can assume that there is a source directory 
two directories above containing the name of the module eg:

qmp/ib-mpi/build/configure.sh 

can assume the existence of qmp/qmp or equivalently ../../qmp

This directory is not there in the source checked out of the 
repository but is created by a CVS checkout prior to  the invocation
of configure.sh. The creation is done by the checkout task in build.sh

(Here we differ from the nightly build, which contained this directory
and used CVS update to update the source in it - since we are checking 
this system into the CVS, I wanted to cut out this source and so 
it is now checked out using a checkout)
	

Running:
========

Once this module is checked out, build and installation of the modules
should be possible by invoking build.sh

Will it run regression tests?
=============================

Yes, regression tests will be run for some targets. Currently
regression tests will only run for targets that are easy (nonparallel)
where invocations of QMP_run.sh or mpirun are not required

What if something goes wrong:
============================

Logs are placed in the logs/ subdirectory using the scheme

	logs/module/target/action_date.gz

where module is the module name (qmp,qdp++,chroma)
target is one of the build target names
action is one of the actions (checkout, configure, build, install, link, check, xcheck)
date is the date string created at the time of the build


That's too easy, there must  be more to install
===============================================

Yes there is:

-  Infiniband OSU/MPI be installed into /usr/local/ibgd
   as per the Mellanox IBGD 1.18.0 distribution.

-  The base GigE Mesh drivers need to be installed

-  xmldiff needs to be installed for the regression tests to work.
   (http://forge.nesc.ac.uk/xmldiff)

-  Perl is needed to run the regression tests in chroma.

I knew it! What esle is missing?
================================

  - Myrinet builds are not being done. Chiefly because we haven't got
  myrinet onto the 2.6 kernel machines.


Wow! This is nifty! Can it possibly get better?
===============================================

Yes. It would be cool for example ro be able to run regressions for
the parallel targets. It would be cool to support gcc-4 based targets
etc. It may even be most cool, to somehow transmogrify this process into
building RPMS including possibly a top level virtual one, so that you'd 
only have to build this stuff once, turn it into RPMs and then just
load those onto the new machines.

OK, give me the boring details

(*) We have not made the regression tests portable amongst our parallel
systems. For example, the command to executre a program is different
under gig-E and mpi. Also the regressions we do have tend to work
on small lattices which may not be suitable for a given parallel decomposition.
We have asked for SciDAC funds to research into this in SciDAC 2.
